# SplitIt
A mobile application for splitting bills and managing payments among multiple group members. The app allows users to create groups, add shared expenses, and split costs among group members fairly. Each user can add expenses, view their balance, and make payments directly through the app, eliminating confusion about who owes what. The app provides automatic notifications to remind group members of outstanding payments and generates detailed reports on each memberâ€™s expenses.
